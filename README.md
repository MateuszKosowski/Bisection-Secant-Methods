Task objectives:
Implement and compare two methods of solving (finding the zero place) nonlinear equations. Each laboratory group implements the bisection method and one of the variants assigned by the instructor. Our variant is the secant method with an estimate of the result accuracy using the formula: |x_i-x_(i-1) |<Îµ
